# Life Expectancy Project

## Overview

The Life Expectancy Project is an individual data analysis and machine learning project that aims to predict life expectancy based on various factors. The dataset used in this project consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows, which includes 20 predicting variables. These variables belong to different categories, such as Immunization-related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors, and Social factors.

## Project Description

In this project, the following key tasks are considered:

### Data Cleaning and Visualization

- Cleaned the dataset to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
- Utilized libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  to visualize and explore the data.
- This data visualization step helped gain insights into the relationships between various variables and life expectancy.

### Data Preprocessing

- Performed data preprocessing tasks, including:
  - Train-test split to create a training set and a test set.
  - Handling missing values, either by filling them in or removing rows with missing data.
  - Encoding categorical variables to convert them into a numerical format.
  - Scaling numerical features to ensure all features have the same scale.

### Statistical Analysis

- Conducted statistical analysis, including implementing multiple linear regression to understand the relationships between predictors and life expectancy.

### Machine Learning Models

- Utilized various machine learning models for prediction purposes, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Lasso Regression
  - Random Forest
